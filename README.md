#README

## Introduction

Use this code when you want to identify data within the same row of your datafile. i.e. if you want to find a certain property from a specific sample/date.

This excellent template was forked from OCG404-CSC593/ghpages_template, which is based on the Minimal Jekyll theme for GitHub Pages.

## Requirements
- Data file in .xlsx format.
- could use a csv file, but you would need to edit to pd.read_csv.
